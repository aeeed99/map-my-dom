  PROBLEM: Error thrown with the following text:
    <html>
    <head>
    <this>filler?</this>
    </head>
    <body>
    </html>
  SOLUTION: this was incorrectly formatted html (extra opening tag in body). Created a new scenerio that checks for this and returns an ERROR node
            this allows most of the DOM to be rendered correctly and a word of caution in an area that isn't.
