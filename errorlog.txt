  STATUS: Closed - Solved
  PROBLEM: Cannot parse multiple classes.
  EXAMPLE: <div class="class1 class2 class3">hello</div>m</div>
  SOLUTION: regex expanded to find all spaces within quotes in tag attributes, and returns only the first/
  NOTES: This does not allow parsing of multiple classes and this feature might want to be extended later.

      <div>Here is a child parent. this should be no problem</div>
    </div>
  NOTES: Might want to try running through parseStr
  SOLUTION: n/a;

  STATUS: Open - Bug
  PROBLEM: Cannot parse and/or render multiple children with the same parent
  EXAMPLE: <html>
            <div>
              The first child
            </div>
            <div>
              The second child
            </div>
            <div>
              The Third child.
            </div>
            </html>
  SOLUTION: n/a.
  NOTES: Run the test case. Children with children seem to be rendered ok, it's children WITH children that might have problems....

  STATUS: Closed - Solved.
  PROBLEM: Error thrown with the following text:
    <html>
    <head>
    <this>filler?</this>
    </head>
    <body>
    </html>
  SOLUTION: this was incorrectly formatted html (extra opening tag in body). Created a new scenerio that checks for this and returns an ERROR node
            this allows most of the DOM to be rendered correctly and a word of caution in an area that isn't.
